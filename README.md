# CSharpAdvanced

## Description
Here's most of the advanced topics in C# with simple code examples in ONE solution. The solution is divided into two projects, one for LINQ and the other for the rest of topics. I've added comments so no worries.


## Table of Contents

- **C# Advanced Topics**:
1. Extension Methods
2. Recursion
3. Delegates
4. Events
5. MultiThreading
6. Task-based Asynchronous Pattern (TAP) - Async/Await
7. Enumerables
8. Generics
9. Operator Overloading
10. Object Method Overrides
11. Records

- **LINQ - Language Integrated Query**:
1. Projection and Filtering (Select, Where, OfType, SelectMany, Zip)
2. Sorting (OrderBy, OrderByDescending, ThenBy, ThenByDescending, Reverse)
3. Quantifiers (Any, All, Contains)
4. Partitioning (Skip, SkipLast, SkipWhile, Take, TakeLast, TakeWhile, Chunk)
5. Set Operations (Distinct, DistinctBy, Except, ExceptBy, Intersect, IntersectBy, Union, UnionBy)
6. Joins (Join, LeftJoin, RightJoin, GroupJoin)
7. Grouping (GroupBy, ToLookup)
8. Generating Sequences (Range, Repeat, Empty, DefaultIfEmpty)
9. Element Operations (ElementAt, ElementAtOrDefault, First, FirstOrDefault, Last, LastOrDefault, Single, SingleOrDefault)
10. Sequence Equality (SequenceEqual)
11. Concatenation (Concat)
12. Aggregation (Aggregate, AggregateBy, Count, LongCount, CountBy, Max, MaxBy, Min, MinBy, Sum, Average)
13. Expression Trees
14. IEnumerable vs IQueryable - Explained


## Installation
1. Clone the repository
```git
git clone https://github.com/AhmedMohamedGab/CSharp-Advanced-Topics.git
```
2. Open the solution in **Visual Studio 2026** using `File > Open > Project/Solution` or use the CLI:
```bash
dotnet restore dotnet build dotnet run --project src/CSharpAdvanced
```


## Usage
"Program.cs" file in both projects is divided into sections. Sections are separated with a separator comment.
1. Uncomment one section at a time to avoid errors.
2. Review the code and run to test
3. Make your changes and see how the output changes consequently
